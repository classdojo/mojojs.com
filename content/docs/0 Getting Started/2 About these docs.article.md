These docs are here to guide you through building a scalable Mojo application. Some of the examples used
are intentionally inconsistent since there is no real right or wrong way to build mojo applications. There
are many different styles, pick whatever flavor suites your needs.

Most of the examples provided in these docs are fully editable, and runnable. The examples also automatically resolve any NPM modules using [browserify CDN](http://wzrd.in/), so you can load any remote NPM repository you want.
